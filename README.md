# Minimal Desktop Indicator

An indicator/switcher for your virtual desktops/workspaces (also known as a "pager"), which shows the amount of virtual desktops available, and highlights the current one - all using simple unicode text characters.

As a former GNOME user, I was a huge fan of the Workspace Indicator extension found at <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3952/workspace-indicator/>, so I decided to re-create it for Plasma to help me feel at home. I enjoy the minimalist style (hence my naming choice), and I'm hoping you do too!

***NOTE: For now, this applet simply shows the current workspace and available workspaces and nothing else. I will be adding more features in the coming weeks! If you find any bugs or would like to see a feature added, please open an issue!***

### To-Do List:
* Add settings menu
* Click/scroll to advance workspaces
* Vertical panel support
* Customisable indicator size
* Support for multi-monitor setups
